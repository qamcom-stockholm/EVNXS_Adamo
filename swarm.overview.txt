    service:
        network
        ports
        # of replicas
        storage
        ---- if reconfigured, Docker restart them automatically
swarm manager   
    swarm service
        tasks: running container
Docker hosts can also participate in swarm together with swarm services
submit swarm service ---tasks---> manager node -> node_1
                                            -> node_2
                                            -> node_3
swarm service
    container to use
    command to run in the container
global vs replicated services

-----------------------------------------------
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>

docker info : 
    shows the current state of the swarm
docker node ls
    shows the list of nodes

on the worker machine run:
    docker swarm join --token <TOKEN> <MANAGER_IP>:<PORT>
on the manager node:
    docker swarm jon-token worker
    shows the token  for worker join


on the manager machine
    docker service create --replicas 1 --name helloworld alpine ping docker.com
    docker service ls
        shows the list of services
    docker service inspect --pretty <SERVICE_ID>
        shows the state of the service
    docker service ps <SERVICE_ID>
        shows the nodes that running the service
    docker service scale <SERVICE_ID>=<SCALE_NUMBER>
        scales the service to the SCALE_NUMBER
    docker service rm <SERVICE_ID>
    docker service update --image <IMAGE> <SERVICE_ID> 

    docker node update --availability drain <NODE_ID>
        drain the node to avoid accepting new tasks and stop running current tasks
